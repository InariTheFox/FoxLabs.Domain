# FoxLabs.Domain
Components to help you design Event Driven applications quickly and easily. Based upon the Mediator and Aggregate patterns, domain events are capable of being used locally within the application, or extended to be distributed via external an event bus such as RabbitMQ, Transit and Kafka.

This code is inspired by the Microsoft eShopOnContainers code hosted at https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers.

Special thanks goes to Robert Fowler for being an important part of my development as software developer and architect.
